# wgrc-wp
This plugin embeds a table view of the Wheat Genetics Resource Center (WGRC) database at Kansas State University into a WordPress page using shortcode.

It is currently being used on the database page of the WGRC website here: https://wgrc.k-state.edu/database/

The WGRC database runs on MySQL and is hosted on a server at Kansas State University. Two of its tables, wp_genetic_stocks and wp_germplasm, have been migrated and added to the MySQL database of the WGRC website. The plugin queries these two local database tables from within WordPress.

This plugin is developed by the Poland Lab (https://wheatgenetics.k-state.edu/), Department of Plant Pathology, at Kansas State University.
